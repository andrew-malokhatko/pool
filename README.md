# Quickstart
Open the terminal and clone the repo with :
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/andrew-malokhatko/pool
  cd pool
```

Now create a build directory and run initialize cmake :
```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
```

Finally build the project :
```bash
  cmake --build .
```

And run the program with :
```
  ./Balls
```

That's it, everything should be working now.
